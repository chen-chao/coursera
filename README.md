# coursera

## INTRO

coursera contains the programming assignments of classes(not restricted to
coursera, though), including:

* [C程序设计](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-chengxu-sheji/)

Introduction to C programming in Chinese on coursera, held by
[Ge Li](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/ligechina). However, the assignment is
compiled with `g++`. Assignment descriptions are in the source file or in
a seperated file.

* [Algorithm, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/)

Introduction to essential data structure and algorithms in JAVA on coursera, held by
[Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~250165),
including stack, queue, sorting algorithms, binary search tree and so on.

* [The C Programming Language](http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions) 

K&R's *The C Programming Language* exercises. Answers on
[clc-wiki](http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions) are refered. Useful hints
or code snippets are jotted down. The exercises use gcc default standard, except
sometimes, where "-ansi" option must be specified when compiling, to avoid
conflict function name `getline` defined in `stdio.h`
([Chapter 4](./tcpl/chapter_4)). If there are more than one source file, a makefile will
be provided.
