## INTRO

coursera contains  the programming assignments of coursera classes, including:

* [C程序设计](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-chengxu-sheji/)

* [Algorithms Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/)

* [The C Programming Language](http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions) 

K&M's *The C Programming Language* exercises. At most times [the
answers on the clc-wiki](http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions)
are refered when the exercise is finished, and useful hints or code
snippets are jotted down. Though the book obeys the ansi C standard,
the exercises use gcc default standard, except sometimes(like [Chapter
4](./tcpl/chapter_4)), where "-ansi" option must be specified when
compiling, to avoid conflict function name `getline` defined in
`stdio.h`. At most time, if there are more than one source file, a
makefile will be provided.
